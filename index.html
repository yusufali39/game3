<p id="tnc"> Hey guys, <b><i>Aayan</i></b> this side. <br> Welcome to our maths game website, where learning and fun go hand in hand! <br> I have game at three different difficulty levels: easy,
    medium, and hard. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, I've got something
    for everyone. 
    Easy level games are perfect for those just starting out. <br> These games cover basic
    concepts like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The easy level games are
    designed to help you build a strong foundation in mathematicics, which is essential for future learning. <br> 
    Medium and Hard levels games are a step up from the easy level respectively. They cover topics same as easy level but some twists.
    These games are great for learners who have mastered the
    basics and want to improve their math skills.<br>
    I believe that learning math should be fun and enjoyable, which is why we've created
    engaging games that make learning math feel like play. So, come and explore my website
    and see for yourself how much fun math can be! <br>Thank you!!</p>
